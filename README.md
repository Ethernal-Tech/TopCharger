# TopCharger
Weâ€™re building an **open**, **on-chain** network where *anyone* â€” homeowners, hotels, gas stations â€”  can host a charger, and anyone can charge without special cards or memberships.
Our app finds the **best charger for you** based on what matters most:
**Closest, Cheapest, Fastest, Greenest, or Most Reliable**.
You can even **book your spot ahead** and skip the wait entirely.
**Hosts earn rewards** for uptime, using renewable energy, and providing services in underserved areas,  while **drivers earn points** for feedback and loyalty.
Payments are **smooth**, onboarding is **instant** â€” no passwords, no hassles.
All charging data lives securely on **Solana**, ensuring transparency and trust for users, cities, and utilities alike.

## Features
- **User authentication** via Google or Solana wallet  
- **Role selection** after first login (Host or Driver)
